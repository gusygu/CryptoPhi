Hi,

This is gus.

I've never written a readme.md file,

This project has initially been built to support a multiple arbitrage trading strategy. Arbitrage (also known as triangular arbitrage) is a method of increasing revenues by repeatedly performin trading operations between successive deflated currencies. First>Second>Third>First. This usually happens over time in a non-evident way. This project aims to establish an intuitive tool for visualizating the market conditions. It also aims for market sanitized market data collecion, so as the upcoming statistical treatment methods (intend to be normalised(converted) into meaningful values) can properly describe the cryptomarket fluctuations.
Initially it was expected, at this test deployment, to have the innovative graphic consolidated, so visualization gets more visually intuitive. It' expected to have within the 4th update counting from this date the 3D repreentation of statistical metrics contained in the app. Statisticl techniques are also expected to increase: it would, most likely, include multiple statistical approach to draw a meaningful predictive value of the market variation, which would enhance, and even at most, viabilize minor automated process for assets rebalance. The automation wouldn't be expected to run on full trading capabilities, for several reasons; it'd be designed for wallet balance recovery and reinjection (due to operation error on adverse market environmental conditions).
Utmost, cryptophi aims to unfold in a complete Web3.0 access platform, relating to art and other components of the latest web scenario.
Finally, the app is currently on test phase so several errors may happen, and some features may malfunction in individual and collective way. Calculations from matrices have been revised and should be properly working (I know this page is disappointing, but it does seem to work well), str-aux (strategy-auxiliary)has not been fully checked regarding the statistics meaning valoration, calculations are being revised and referential values for each metric will be presented in documentation by the end of this afternoon. Cin-aux (cinetics auxiliary) is functional and report the basic PnL information for ledger inserted operations, it's uncertain if db is happening on shared conditions for now, it' supposed to get an RLS individual saving, deeper data (comparative to moo-aux (mood-auxiliary)) should be available after db fixes; moo-aux contains the functional algorithm(not fully revised) that cross-validate market data (id_pct (instant percetual variation) and str-aux metrics) in a combinatory ledger so as to result in an optimised value to be applied: this value is suggested based the number of evaluated selected coins (not yet individually implemented, under fixes) that splits the values in all currencies and this remaining value into minor fractions. This allows a constant balance in all coins that can be displaced according to market variation.

The project i majorly under ongoing deployment fix process, recent coding tools subscription have allowed highly increased performance which may accelerate the app building progress.

Since this first project deployment has been proved minimaly viable, and most components have been structurally stable, new (undisclosed name) projects may be forwarded in parallel restricting update actvity.
Nevertheless, given recent trials upon the new environment composition, updates may be meaningful in less time then the core app building (from mid25).

Updates are intended to happen weekly, usually at wednesdays or fridays.

Sponsoring and funding are not yet considered given the current app condition, which do not allow market deployment neither assure the tool safety.

Hope tests may bring upon good results.

u r amazing guys, ty!!


(unfortunately the current available fund for the tool subscription has ended, so the first updates enabling the app complete appropriate deployment will be delayed)
