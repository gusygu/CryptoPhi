Hi,

I'd like to present you and invite the hereby invited readers to join the testing phase of cryptophi. Cryptophi has arised initially as a project of mine designed to be an intuitive tool to compile read and abstract cryptomarket data: for that I've designed a new proposal of graphic abstraction, which must be brought upon later in the initial updates: the test launch phase marks the begin of this second developent phase.
Cryptophi has not been designed to be a market-only activity tool, it does not contain automated functions an do not operate remotely onbinance or anyother cryptocurrency market. In the present momemt it just dispose of a few statistically treated data, opaque ratio matrices, and two algorithms in incipient phases which aim for optimised trade, regarding a not described strategy of cyclic trading (called arbitrage) and one designed for PnL informs.

I'm tired for now, so these are the first words of readme, I'll update it around every micro-update.
