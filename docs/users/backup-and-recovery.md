# Backup & Recovery (User Overview)

How your data stays safe, without exposing internal details.

- Regular backups of the service database are taken by operators. This includes your settings, invites, and account state.
- Restores are tested in non-production environments to ensure backups are usable.
- If you notice missing data after an outage, contact support; your account state can be validated against backups.
- Your live session may expire after maintenance; sign back in on the same host.
