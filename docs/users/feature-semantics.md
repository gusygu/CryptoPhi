# Feature Semantics (Lite)

Quick meanings behind key UI areas.

- **Matrices**: Colors reflect simple math: ratio above 1 is green, below 1 is red, near-flat is neutral. Frozen highlights mean values barely changed across polls.
- **Dynamics**: Same data as matrices, focused on motion/tempo.
- **STR-AUX**: Live sampler; if restarted, it reloads and warms up from scratch.
- **Settings**: Coin universe (USDT always included), timing controls, engine parameters. Invalid inputs keep prior values.
- **Mood**: Averages of id_pct plus simple bucket counts; no complex statistics.
- **Invites**: One-time links tied to your email; registration email is read-only.
